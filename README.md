This is the semester-long assignment for the Compilers class at Algqonquin College. It is a 
front-end compiler for the Platypus language designed by Prof. Svillen Ranev.

It consists of 4 parts:
* Buffer
  * The core component that handles "strings". It includes iteration and expansion/reallocation.
* Scanner
  * The scanner reads in tokens from the program file.
* Symbol Table
  * The symbol table is an index of the programs identifiers.
* Parser
  * The parser makes sure the program is syntactically valid.
